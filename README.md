# Plant Disease Detection with Deep Learning 

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant leaf diseases based on the PlantVillage dataset. The primary goal is to develop a high-accuracy, scalable, and interpretable deep learning model that assists in early disease diagnosis in agricultureâ€”supporting food security and modern farming.
